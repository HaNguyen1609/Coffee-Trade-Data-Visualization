### Prepare Data

```{r}

poverty_lines = read.csv(file = 'national-poverty-lines-vs-gdp-per-capita.csv')
coffee_consumption = read.csv(file = 'disappearance.csv')
#rename columns
colnames(retail_prices)[which(names(retail_prices) == 'retail_prices')] = 'country'
#subset columns from poverty lines
poverty_lines = data.frame(subset(poverty_lines, select = c(National.poverty.lines..Jolliffe.and.Prydz..2016..,Entity,Year)))                             
#remove NAs

### Visualizing total producion over the years
```{r}

```
